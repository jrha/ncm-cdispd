2005-07-26  Juan Antonio LOPEZ PEREZ

        * Release: 1.1.7
        - Corrected the Solaris postinstall script

	Now it will start the daemon after the installation of the package
	but only if the process wp4.install is not running. This process
	runs when a new machine is installed. If cdp-listend and cdispd 
	are running while installing a machine, they can call spma without
	any control at the same time we are installing the packages.

2005-05-20  Juan Antonio LOPEZ PEREZ

        * Release: 1.1.1
	
        - Solved a bug related with the success/failure notification in
	rcinit-ncm-cdispd.cin . The "success || failure" call on the start 
	subroutine is not neccesary because the subroutine daemon does that.

	- Solaris porting:

	   - Added the variable QTTR_INITD in the Makefile, the specfile and
	the rcinit-ncm-cdispd.cin to take into account that in Solaris the
	startup scripts are in /etc/rc.d while in Linux, at CERN, they are
	in /etc/rc.d/init.d

	   - Added the variable QTTR_LOCKD in the config.mk and 
	rcinit-ncm-cdispd.cin files to take into account the different lock
	directory in Linux and Solaris.

	   - Added the variable QTTR_SBIN in rcinit-ncm-cdispd.cin to take
	into account the different sbin directory used by Quattor in Linux 
	and Solaris.

	   - Corrected the lines including "echo -n" and $"...",
	not supported by the Solaris sh.
